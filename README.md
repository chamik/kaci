## Development

To start the live server run:
```sh
$ npm run dev
```

If you edited any of the configuration files while the live server was running, you will need to restart it for the changes to take effect.

Once you're happy with your site, terminate your live server and run:
```sh
$ npm run build
```

The output will be in the `build/` directory.

Happy coding!
